`Hiina - The Community Alphabet` is a geometric typeface that was created when we were rebranding from DSC UEM to Google Developer Student Club UEM, and we were developing a lot of new and exciting projects and we were thinking about how we can bring it all together and create a unique visual language
So we started designing a logo for our newsletter, was inspired by the result, and started working to expand the style and build an entire alphabet.
